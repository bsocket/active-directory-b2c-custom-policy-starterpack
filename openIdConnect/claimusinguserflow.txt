Claim type	Value	Notes
exp	Tue Jun 30 2020 12:57:52 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	The expiration time claim is the time at which the token becomes invalid, represented in epoch time. Your app should use this claim to verify the validity of the token lifetime.
nbf	Tue Jun 30 2020 11:57:52 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	This claim is the time at which the token becomes valid, represented in epoch time. This is usually the same as the time the token was issued. Your app should use this claim to verify the validity of the token lifetime.
ver	1.0	The version of the ID token, as defined by Azure AD B2C.
iss	https://chprodb2c.b2clogin.com/ca87d35e-03fc-4de7-8565-4020cc890235/v2.0/	This claim identifies the security token service (STS) that constructs and returns the token. It also identifies the Azure AD directory in which the user was authenticated. Your app should validate the issuer claim to ensure that the token came from the v2.0 endpoint. It also should use the GUID portion of the claim to restrict the set of tenants that can sign in to the app.
sub	057b4197-e625-4cf6-878f-00d2de8aa620	This is the principal about which the token asserts information, such as the user of an app. This value is immutable and cannot be reassigned or reused. It can be used to perform authorization checks safely, such as when the token is used to access a resource. By default, the subject claim is populated with the object ID of the user in the directory. To learn more, see Azure Active Directory B2C: Token, session, and single sign-on configuration.
aud	5f1c51be-73a5-4f9f-823f-6fb7ec148d2d	An audience claim identifies the intended recipient of the token. For Azure AD B2C, the audience is your app's Application ID, as assigned to your app in the app registration portal. Your app should validate this value and reject the token if it does not match.
nonce	defaultNonce	A nonce is a strategy used to mitigate token replay attacks. Your app can specify a nonce in an authorization request by using the nonce query parameter. The value you provide in the request will be emitted unmodified in the nonce claim of an ID token only. This allows your app to verify the value against the value it specified on the request, which associates the app's session with a given ID token. Your app should perform this validation during the ID token validation process.
iat	Tue Jun 30 2020 11:57:52 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	The time at which the token was issued, represented in epoch time.
auth_time	Tue Jun 30 2020 11:57:52 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)	This claim is the time at which a user last entered credentials, represented in epoch time.
idp	https://portaldevidservice-as.azurewebsites.net	The identity provider used by the user to authenticate.
given_name	Ajay	The user's given name (also known as first name).
tfp	B2C_1_wpsusi	This is the name of the policy that was used to acquire the token.
